          <h2>Emmeline Pankhurst</h2>
          <p>Emmeline Pankhurst founded the Women’s Social and Political Union in 1918. The members, known as the Suffragettes, fought to enfranchise women in the United Kingdom. Pankhurst was imprisoned many times due to her efforts. Parliament granted British women limited suffrage in 1918. Pankhurst died in 1928, shorty before women were given full voting rights.</p>

          <h2>Angela Davis (1944-), Academic Activist, Civil Rights Activist, Scholar, Women’s Rights Activist</h2>
          <p>Angela Davis emerged as a radical activist in the 1960s as a leader in the Communist Party USA, and was affiliated with the Black Panther Party through her involvement in the Civil Rights Movement. She was a professor (now retired) at the University of California, Santa Cruz, as a director of the university’s Feminist Studies department and the History of Consciousness Department. Davis not only understands the vital nature of intersectional feminism-she embodies it throughout all her activism. Davis is heavily involved in activism pertaining to prisoner’s rights and solidarity with Palestine and was an important figure in the Occupy Wall Street movement.</p>
